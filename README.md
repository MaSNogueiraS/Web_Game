- The game will crash if you change the spawn delay (500 milliseconds) in the spawnEnemiesGradually() function
- Some unused variables and functions from the original code are still there
- The player movement is not very smooth, it could be improved to improve the accuracy of the shots
- Poor background
- The game is not very fun, it could be improved by adding more features, like, bosses and power-ups
